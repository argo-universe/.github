Argo Universe is a comprehensive Kubernetes resource boilerplate consisting of multiple repositories. Our primary goal is to share our expertise and experience with the community by providing a Kubernetes stack example using only ArgoCD. This is a sample GitOps methodology that offers all the necessary components in a few simple steps.

We have developed a collection of repositories, known as Argo Universe, to serve as a starting point for individuals interested in GitOps, ArgoCD, or Kubernetes. It features an ArgoCD boilerplate that can be utilized as a reference or launchpad.

Furthermore, we have supplementary repositories that store example app and application configurations. These repositories offer a sample workflow for constructing and deploying an application.
